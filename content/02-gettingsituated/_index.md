## Overview
In this section we will drive you through the setup of your AWS
account to run Neuropointillist. We will do the following:

- Log onto the AWS Management Console. 

- Launch a cloud based IDE (AWS Cloud9). This is like your terminal in
  the cloud. We will use this environment to launch a cluster. You can also launch a cluster
  from your own computer, but because people have different
  setups, it is easier for us to walk you through if everyone is on
  the same platform (Cloud9).


- Create a configuration file for a cluster to run Neuropointillist. We have installed some neuroimaging software and data for you to create a neuroimaging environment for this lab. The Appendix describes what we did and how you can modify the environment.

- Launch a graphical desktop to that cluster.
