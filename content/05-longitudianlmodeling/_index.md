Some basic information on modeling fMRI data using R can be found
below. This is helpful to demystify how what you run in your fMRI
software relates to what you can run with common statistical packages.

Model](https://psyarxiv.com/crx4m/)

If you are unfamilar with longitudinal modeling in general, or with
longitudinal models in R specifically, this is some useful background.
